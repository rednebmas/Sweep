Sweep inverts the typical inbox workflow. Instead of archiving emails you don't want, you mark emails you want to Keep - everything else is automatically archived when you close the app.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Open the app to see emails since your last session
2. Swipe right on emails worth keeping
3. Close the app - everything else is archived
4. Repeat daily

The default is gone. This forces intentional decisions about what actually deserves your attention.

KEY FEATURES:

- One swipe to keep: Swipe right on any email to mark it as important
- Auto-archive: Non-kept emails are archived when you leave the app
- Undo support: Accidentally archived something? Restore entire sessions from Settings
- Block senders: Long-press to block, mark as spam, or unsubscribe
- Morning reminder: Daily notification to sweep your inbox
- Full email view: Tap any email to read the complete thread

Designed for inbox zero without the effort. Stop spending time deciding what to archive. Just keep what matters.

Requires a Gmail account.
