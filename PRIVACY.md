## Overview

Sweep is an open-source iOS app that helps you manage your email inbox. This policy explains how the app handles your data.

## Data Collection

Sweep does **not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to external servers. All data processing happens locally on your device.

## Gmail API Usage

Sweep uses the Gmail API to:
- Read your emails to display them in the app
- Archive emails and mark them as read
- Mark emails as spam
- Create email filters to block senders

Your Gmail credentials are handled securely through Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication. Sweep never sees or stores your Google password.

## Data Storage

- Email metadata (for sweep history) is stored locally on your device using SwiftData
- App preferences are stored locally using UserDefaults
- No data is sent to third-party analytics or tracking services

## Third-Party Services

The only external service Sweep connects to is the Gmail API, governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Open Source

Sweep is open source. You can review the complete source code to verify these privacy practices.
